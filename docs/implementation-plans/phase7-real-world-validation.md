# Phase 7: Real-World Validation - Implementation Plan

**Status:** 📋 **PLANNED**

**Goal:** Validate playwright-rust through real-world usage, incorporate user feedback, complete deferred documentation, and prepare for v1.0.0 release.

**User Story:** As a Rust developer using playwright-rust in production, I want comprehensive examples and migration guides based on real usage patterns, performance optimizations informed by actual bottlenecks, and a stable v1.0.0 release that addresses real-world needs.

**Approach:** Feedback-driven development based on v0.6.0 usage and folio integration

---

## Strategic Context

Phase 7 represents a shift from feature implementation to real-world validation. After releasing v0.6.0 in Phase 6, we'll gather feedback from:

1. **Folio Integration** - Direct experience integrating playwright-rust into a real project
2. **Early Adopters** - Community users trying v0.6.0
3. **Performance Metrics** - Real-world performance data
4. **Migration Experiences** - Actual challenges when moving from other libraries

This feedback-driven approach ensures we're solving real problems, not theoretical ones.

## Deferred from Phase 6

### High Priority

1. **Examples and Migration Guide** (Phase 6 Slice 5)
   - **Why Deferred**: Need real-world usage patterns to create meaningful examples
   - **Will Include**:
     - Advanced examples addressing common use cases discovered through folio
     - Migration guides tackling actual pain points from users switching libraries
     - Getting Started tutorial refined from onboarding experiences
     - Troubleshooting guide based on real issues encountered
   - **Success Metric**: Examples directly address top 5 user pain points

### Medium Priority

2. **Performance Optimizations** (Informed by real usage)
   - Profile actual bottlenecks from folio integration
   - Optimize based on real performance data, not assumptions
   - May include deferred items from Phase 6 if they prove important:
     - GUID string optimization
     - Transport chunked reading

3. **API Enhancements** (Based on user requests)
   - FilePayload struct (if users need it)
   - BrowserContext options (if requested)
   - Route continue overrides (if use cases emerge)

## Phase 7 Slices (Tentative)

### Slice 1: Folio Integration & Dogfooding

**Goal:** Integrate playwright-rust into folio project, document pain points

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Replace existing browser automation with playwright-rust
- [ ] Document integration challenges
- [ ] Identify missing features or rough edges
- [ ] Create list of needed examples
- [ ] Performance profiling in real usage

**Success Criteria:**
- Folio successfully using playwright-rust in production
- Pain points documented and prioritized
- Performance baseline established

---

### Slice 2: Community Feedback Analysis

**Goal:** Gather and analyze technical feedback from v0.6.0 early adopters

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Collect bug reports and feature requests
- [ ] Identify common integration challenges
- [ ] Analyze usage patterns and pain points
- [ ] Prioritize fixes and enhancements

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear list of technical issues to address
- Prioritized feature backlog
- Understanding of real-world usage patterns

---

### Slice 3: Examples and Documentation (Informed by Feedback)

**Goal:** Create practical examples and guides based on real usage

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create examples addressing top use cases from folio
- [ ] Write migration guides for actual migration paths users took
- [ ] Develop troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create cookbook-style examples for complex scenarios

**Success Criteria:**
- Examples directly solve real user problems
- Migration guides address actual pain points
- Clear documentation for common patterns

---

### Slice 4: Performance Optimization (Data-Driven)

**Goal:** Optimize based on real-world performance data

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Analyze performance data from folio usage
- [ ] Profile memory usage in long-running applications
- [ ] Optimize hot paths identified through profiling
- [ ] Implement caching where beneficial
- [ ] Consider async optimizations

**Success Criteria:**
- 20% performance improvement in common operations
- Memory usage stable in long-running apps
- No performance regressions

---

### Slice 5: API Polish and Enhancements

**Goal:** Implement high-value features requested by users

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement top 3 requested features
- [ ] Polish rough edges discovered through usage
- [ ] Improve error messages based on confusion points
- [ ] Add convenience methods for common patterns
- [ ] Consider builder pattern improvements

**Success Criteria:**
- User-requested features implemented
- API feels natural for Rust developers
- Error messages helpful and actionable

---

### Slice 6: v1.0.0 Release Preparation

**Goal:** Prepare for stable v1.0.0 release

**Tasks:**
- [ ] API stability review
- [ ] Breaking change assessment
- [ ] Comprehensive CHANGELOG
- [ ] Migration guide from v0.6.0 to v1.0.0
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] License review
- [ ] Publish to crates.io

**Success Criteria:**
- API stable with no planned breaking changes
- Security and license approved
- v1.0.0 published and announced
- Positive initial reception

---

## Technical Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- < 5 critical bugs in production use
- 95% API stability (minimal breaking changes)
- Performance within 10% of playwright-python
- Zero memory leaks in long-running applications
- Clean resource cleanup in all scenarios

### Implementation Metrics
- Folio integration working smoothly
- All deferred features implemented based on need
- Test coverage maintained above 80%
- Documentation answers 90% of user questions

---

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **API Stability** - Which APIs to mark as stable vs experimental
2. **Performance Trade-offs** - Where to optimize vs maintain simplicity
3. **Feature Scope** - Which deferred features are actually needed
4. **Breaking Changes** - What changes justify a major version bump

---

## Technical Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Major bugs discovered in production | Delays v1.0.0 | Thorough testing in folio first |
| API changes needed | Breaking changes | Early validation, deprecation strategy |
| Performance issues | Poor user experience | Profile early and often |
| Platform-specific bugs | Limited adoption | Test on all platforms regularly |

---

## Notes

- This plan will be refined based on actual Phase 6 completion
- Slices may be reordered based on technical priorities
- Focus on solving real problems discovered through usage
- Keep implementation lean until patterns emerge
