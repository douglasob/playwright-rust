# Phase 6: Production Hardening - Implementation Plan

**Status:** 🚀 **IN PROGRESS**

**Goal:** Polish for production use, address deferred items, comprehensive documentation, and prepare for v1.0.0 release.

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want playwright-rust to be production-ready with comprehensive documentation, Windows support, and all deferred features completed, so I can confidently use it in production applications.

**Approach:** Vertical Slicing with focus on polish, documentation, and deferred items

---

## Deferred Items from Previous Phases

### High Priority Deferrals

1. **Windows Support** (Phase 1 defer ral)
   - Issue: Integration tests hang on Windows due to stdio pipe cleanup
   - Impact: Blocking Windows users from running tests
   - Location: `crates/playwright-core/src/transport.rs` cleanup logic

2. **to_be_focused() Assertion** (Phase 5 deferral)
   - Reason: Requires 'expect' protocol command or evalOnSelector return values
   - Impact: Missing one assertion from complete coverage
   - Location: `crates/playwright-core/src/assertions.rs:796`

3. **route.fulfill() Main Document Navigation** (Phase 5 known issue)
   - Issue: fulfill() works for fetch/XHR but not main document navigation
   - Impact: Limits response mocking use cases
   - Location: `crates/playwright-core/src/protocol/route.rs:167`

### Medium Priority Deferrals

4. **FilePayload Struct** (Phase 5 deferral)
   - Feature: Structured file upload with name, mimeType, buffer
   - Current: Basic PathBuf-based upload works
   - Impact: Low - basic functionality exists

5. **Transport Chunked Reading** (Performance optimization)
   - TODO: Consider chunked reading for very large messages (>32KB)
   - Location: `crates/playwright-core/src/transport.rs:254`

6. **GUID String Optimization** (Performance)
   - TODO: Avoid cloning GUID by restructuring Channel::new to accept &str
   - Location: `crates/playwright-core/src/channel_owner.rs:261`

### Low Priority Deferrals

7. **Browser Context Options** (Phase 2 deferral)
   - Feature: Full ContextOptions API (viewport, user agent, etc.)
   - Current: Minimal options (empty JSON)
   - Impact: Low - basic context creation works

8. **Route Continue Overrides** (Enhancement)
   - Feature: Modify headers/method/postData when continuing routes
   - Location: `crates/playwright-core/src/protocol/route.rs:127`

## Phase 6 Slices

### Slice 1: Windows Support and Stdio Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix Windows integration test hangs and enable full Windows CI support.

**Completion Date:** 2025-11-09

**Problem:** Tests hang on Windows CI during browser launch and server cleanup due to stdio pipe handling differences between Windows and Unix.

**Solution:** Implemented platform-specific lifecycle management with CI environment detection and browser stability flags.

**Key Architectural Insights:**

1. **Windows CI Environment Requirements** - Browsers in Windows CI environments need specific stability flags that differ from local Windows development. This is not a Rust limitation but a Windows CI environment characteristic (limited sandboxing, process resource constraints). Automatic CI detection allows seamless cross-platform support without user intervention.

2. **Platform-Specific Lifecycle Management** - The `Playwright` struct needs a Drop handler because Windows stdio pipes don't automatically close on process termination like Unix file descriptors do. This is a fundamental platform difference in handle management that affects process cleanup timing.

3. **Cross-Platform Abstraction** - By detecting Windows at the transport layer and implementing platform-specific cleanup, we hide complexity from users while maintaining API compatibility across platforms.

### Slice 2: to_be_focused() Assertion ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Implement the deferred `to_be_focused()` assertion.

**Completion Date:** 2025-11-10

**Problem:** Playwright doesn't expose `isFocused()` at the protocol level, requiring a workaround.

**Solution:** Implemented using JavaScript evaluation to check `document.activeElement === element`, which works across all browsers.

**Key Insight:** The Playwright protocol wraps JavaScript return values in typed objects (`{"b": true}` for booleans), requiring proper parsing in the protocol layer.

---

### Slice 3: Main Document Fulfillment Investigation

**Goal:** Investigate and fix route.fulfill() for main document navigation.

**Why Third:** Limits response mocking capabilities, user-facing issue.

**Research:**
- How does playwright-python handle main document fulfill()?
- What protocol messages are sent for page.goto() fulfillment?
- Is there a different approach for document vs fetch/XHR?

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create test case for main document fulfillment
- [ ] Capture protocol messages for working (playwright-python) vs broken (Rust)
- [ ] Identify difference in protocol communication
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Verify cross-browser
- [ ] Update route.rs documentation

**Files to Modify:**
- `crates/playwright-core/src/protocol/route.rs` - Fix fulfill logic
- `crates/playwright-core/tests/routing_test.rs` - Add main document test

**Success Criteria:**
- route.fulfill() works for main document navigation
- Tests verify HTML replacement works
- Documentation updated to reflect fix

**Alternative:** If unfixable, document as Playwright limitation with workaround.

---

### Slice 4: Documentation Completeness Audit

**Goal:** Ensure all public APIs have comprehensive rustdoc with examples.

**Why Fourth:** Essential for production use, helps users discover features.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Audit all public APIs for rustdoc completeness

**Why Sixth:** Important for production use, but not blocking.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create benchmark suite (criterion.rs)
- [ ] Benchmark: Browser launch time
- [ ] Benchmark: Page navigation
- [ ] Benchmark: Element queries
- [ ] Implement deferred optimizations:
  - Chunked reading for large messages

### Slice 7: Stability Testing and Error Handling

**Goal:** Verify resource cleanup, memory leaks, and error handling.

**Why Seventh:** Production polish, catch edge cases.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Memory leak testing (long-running tests)
- [ ] Resource cleanup verification (file descriptors, processes)
- [ ] Error message quality audit
- [ ] Add context to error messages
- [ ] Test graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- [ ] Test error recovery (network errors, browser crashes)

**Files to Modify:**

**Success Criteria:**
- Features implemented with tests
- Documentation updated
- No regression in existing functionality

---

### Slice 9: v0.6.0 Release Preparation

**Goal:** Prepare for v0.6.0 release to crates.io for friendly user feedback and real-world validation.

**Why Ninth:** Ship working code to get feedback before final v1.0 polish.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md with all changes since v0.5.0
- [ ] Version bump to v0.6.0
- [ ] Final documentation review
- [ ] Final test pass (all platforms)
- [ ] Create GitHub release with notes
- [ ] Publish to crates.io
- [ ] Update README with installation instructions for v0.6.0

**Files to Create:**
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- Release notes in GitHub

**Success Criteria:**
- v0.6.0 published to crates.io
- Documentation is comprehensive enough for early adopters
- Examples work
- Ready for real-world testing in folio and other projects

---

## Success Criteria (Phase 6 Complete)

- ✅ Windows support fully working (tests pass on Windows)
- ✅ All deferred items addressed (HIGH and MEDIUM priority)
- ✅ 100% public API documentation coverage
- ✅ Comprehensive examples and migration guides
- ✅ Performance benchmarks established
- ✅ Stability testing passed (no leaks, clean shutdown)
- ✅ v0.6.0 published to crates.io
- ✅ Ready for real-world validation (folio integration, user feedback)

---

## Guiding Principles for Phase 6

1. **Good Enough for v0.6** - Polished enough for friendly users, not perfect
2. **User Experience** - Documentation and examples help early adopters
3. **Platform Parity** - Windows, macOS, Linux all first-class
4. **Performance** - Fast enough for CI/CD pipelines
5. **Stability** - No surprises, clean error handling
6. **Feedback Ready** - Ship to real users (folio) to inform Phase 7

**Phase 7 Note:** After v0.6.0 release, Phase 7 will focus on real-world validation, folio integration, user feedback incorporation, and final polish before v1.0.0.
